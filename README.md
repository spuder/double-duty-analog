# Double Duty (Analog)
# Double Duty (Analog)
An analog circuit that separates Left, Right and Microhpone Channels

Allows you to connect headphones to multiple computers/phones and quickly switch between them.

E.g.
Left Channel: Computer 1
Right Channel: Computer 2
Microphone: Phone 1

Inspired by the [Little Bear 104](Nobsound Little Bear MC104), but improved by adding a microphone channel.

## Components
- [6X PJ-320 3.5mm Jacks](https://a.co/d/i1pVVkF)
- [3X SR16 Rotary Switches](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2925)
- [1x 8x8 DPDT Push Button Switch (Locking)](https://a.co/d/0V0eQZa)

These switches have mixed reviews. Shop around for higher quality switches. 
You may need a 3d printer to print a button for the switch. 

## Buliding

The CAD directory contains PDFs which can be used to make your own PCB at home using the toner transfer method. 
See VIAS.pdf for highlights of which pads need via connections (use thin wire)

You will also need a drill press.
